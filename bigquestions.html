		<img src="style/images/bigQuestions_4.jpg"><!--<p>1 The happiness book is exuberant and loud (the sewing even forms an exclamation mark), but proves monotonous to move through. The only hint of sourness is a bit of rot (black ink) on the end of one of the untrimmed threads.</p>-->
		<img src="style/images/bigQuestions_5.jpg"><!--<p>2 The meaning book has an acetate jacket that speaks about the veneer of the pursuit of things in the search for meaning, while the book itself has a window that eventually closes completely, leaving viewers confronted by the flat page.</p>-->
		<img src="style/images/bigQuestions_6.jpg"><!--<p>3 The memory book mimics a road map in its form, referencing the idioms around journeys. Rather than just one map, though, there are maps inside of maps, a sort of recursive entropy.</p>-->
		<img src="style/images/bigQuestions_7.jpg">
		<img src="style/images/bigQuestions_8.jpg"><!--<p>4 The love book is the most sequential&mdash;the french-folded pages undergo a series of additive cuts, which reveal organic brushwork. As the cuts become more intricate, the pages move from a fresh red to a coagulated burgundy.</p>-->
		<img src="style/images/bigQuestions_9.jpg"><!--<p>5 The death book is designed as a contemplative experience for viewers. Formally inspired by the ocean, it shuns the idea of a cold and hopeless end, instead presenting a space that is immersive and beautiful.</p>-->
