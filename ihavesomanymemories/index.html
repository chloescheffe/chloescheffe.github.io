				<a>I spent almost all my life in Korea, living with my parents. My brother was in the States, so it was just me and my parents. I think that was the biggest difference, being without my parents. And I suddenly had friends from all over the world. The school was in Hong Kong, but we mostly hung out with exchange students, and they were mostly from Europe—all over Europe, and a few from Asia. So it was really new to me, but really natural how it happened. We were always hanging out together. Later we were kind of like family. That will last forever.</a>

				<a>I really enjoyed being alone when I was in Hong Kong, even though I had times with friends. Because in Korea it’s kind of weird if you’re sitting alone at the restaurant. I don’t mind anymore. I enjoyed that so much in Hong Kong because I know nobody there, except foreign friends, so<br>I would just randomly go to restaurant and have meal by myself and go to a cafe to have dessert and I enjoy it so much.</a>

				<a>After Hong Kong I went back to Korea for two months, then to LA where my brother was, and then we drove to Texas. I was in San Angelo. I was really obsessed with recording what I did that day, even really little things, like ‘someone said this to me’. It was<br>a really intense notebook. I recorded all the things that I forgot if I didn’t record it. The motivation was breakup with my boyfriend in Texas. That was actually a big turning point for me—it really made me grow. That was really hard times—the coldest winter ever in my life.</a>

			<div id="timeline11" class="fade">
				<a>Admire, like respect? I think my brother, even though I don’t want to admit it sometimes. He can really be an asshole sometimes—<br>I hate him sometimes—but I think he’s more rational than me. I’m more—what’s the opposite of rational? I’m more based on feeling. He also has a really clear vision of what he wants to do, and he’s sometimes really unbelievable. During the working hours he was preparing for graduate school secretly, and he studied after coming home from work for GRE. I saw my brother doing this. That was a really good time for us to be together, after like ten years, and get to know each other a little more. Anyway, he was gonna take just one GRE, but then when I talked to him he was taking third GRE because he wasn’t satisfied. It’s not like your parents tell you to do that; it’s on your own. Like you’re doing it for yourself.</a>

				<a>I do a lot of collage, and I end up using a lot of types—typed words—from magazines or something. Maybe that’s an interest of mine.<br>I didn’t really know what I’m getting into with graphic design. But maybe I’ll combine it with<br>the other skills I have. Even when I was doing fine arts, I always wanted to get a job doing cosmetic packaging.</a>

				<a>I can’t even imagine what I’m doing in like two years. It’s becoming more difficult compared to when I was younger, I think. When I was in early 20’s<br>I thought when I’m 26 or 27 I would be married, and really not have any worries. A husband and kids. I don’t know—just really stable. It’s not that anymore. I think being a designer wouldn’t be the goal of my life. But my boyfriend and I are always talking about this. He’s in investment banking right now, but he has this dream of doing a restaurant, like Korean-German mixed. He wants to have a little cafe with a gallery.<br>I think my parents will think it is risky to run a restaurant.</a>

				<a>I do have a favorite book. If it has to be translated, I guess it would be Burning Silence. It’s also a book I read after the Texas breakup. I was going to this art academy to prepare for real for RISD, so I always went there for like five hours a day. I had to take one hour Metro ride to there, so<br>I was always reading in the Metro, kind of obsessively. This person who wrote the book is a famous news anchor and does a lot of TV shows, and she talks about how silence is more important than talking.</a>

				<a>I keep every little notes or letters from middle school, from like sixth grade. It’s in my parents house, and I love to look at them. Because even though you think you know what happened in those days and you have all those memories, you actually forget a lot of parts, and when I go back to my parents house I always look at the box and read it. I like doing that stuff. I collect really little things, like maybe even a candy wrapper if I like it. I keep binders now. All the tickets from movie or museum, especially from the traveling. I really try to collect stuff, even like a flyer from a bar. It’s hard because I also have a lot of photographs printed, and I did<br>use them for some of the projects, but I after that I don’t have them any more to keep. But at the same time I’m not gonna carry that when I’m dying. Maybe I should use them. I still like to print photographs, which not many people except photography major students do.</a>

Memories are a really big part of me, and I think my work as well—it all comes from there. It’s implied—I hope it’s kind of implied when I’m working. I think memory is applied unconsciously.</a>
