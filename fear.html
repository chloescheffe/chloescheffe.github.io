		<span>&para; About halfway through the year, I began struggling with wanting to draw. That is, I didn’t want to. It was a chilly, foreign feeling: I had never struggled the same way with design. (I had hated design in the past, sure, but never had I fully lost the desire to try at it. Hatred has a certain workability; disinterest is cold and dead.) At that point I was not failing, not technically, not publicly, but I was almost always disappointed. Disappointment may sound like a small thing next to failure, but it is debilitating and self-pitying and gross. It lives in the heart.<br><br>And, well—the thing is—disappointment is failure. It’s merely the personal strain. It’s failure in front of yourself. I am my worst critic (as you are yours), and so my disappointment has the cruel, unique ability to delegitimize any creative thing I take up. Public failure has never brought me to the edge; disappointment has. To fail in front of yourself is to fail fundamentally. It is to somehow not do the thing you intend. It’s a deep, deep misalignment. </span>
